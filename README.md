#### I drew a not very smooth Kitty cat using Python code.



- Hello_Kitty.py is the Python program source code. 

  Hello_Kitty.exe is an executable file that can run directly on Windows. If you don't have a Python interpreter.

- If you need a directly runnable file (. app) on Mac, you can contact me.
